# JavaScript automated testing

## Setup
1. Run ```npm -D i mocha sinon chai``` in the project folder
    1. This will *install* (```npm i```) **mocha**, **chai** and **sinon** and add them as *dev dependencies* (```-D```) for the project (more details in the [Node.js / npm section](https://github.com/htbkoo/intro-to-js-react/wiki/Node.js---npm-basics))
2. Check the [```package.json```](https://github.com/htbkoo/intro-to-js-react/blob/master/package.json) file to see that mocha, chai and sinon are installed
    1. Hint: you can also check the versions installed
